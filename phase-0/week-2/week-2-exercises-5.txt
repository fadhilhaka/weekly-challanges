[Exercises 5] Bermain dengan String di JavaScript

1. Let's Form a Sentence

//SET and STORE 'word' to 'JavaScript'
//SET and STORE 'second' to 'is'
//SET and STORE 'third' to 'awesome'
//SET and STORE 'fourth' to 'and'
//SET and STORE 'fifth' to 'I'
//SET and STORE 'sixth' to 'love'
//SET and STORE 'seventh' to 'it'
//DISPLAY word + second + third + fourth + fifth + sixth + seventh

var word = 'JavaScript';
var second = 'is';
var third = 'awesome';
var fourth = 'and';
var fifth = 'I';
var sixth = 'love';
var seventh = 'it!';

console.log(word + ' ' + second + ' ' + third + ' ' + fourth + ' ' + fifth + ' ' + sixth + ' ' + seventh);

2. Index Accessing - 1 by 1

//SET and STORE 'word' to 'wow JavaScript is so cool'
//SET and STORE 'firstWord' to word[0] + word[1] + word[2]
//SET and STORE 'secondWord' to word[4] + word[5] + word[6] + word[7] + word[8] + word[9] + word[10] + word[11] + word[12] + word[13]
//SET and STORE 'thirdWord' to word[15] + word[16]
//SET and STORE 'fourthWord' to word[18] + word[19]
//SET and STORE 'fifthWord' to word[21] + word[22] + word[23] + word[24]
//DISPLAY 'First Word: ' + firstWord
//DISPLAY 'Second Word: ' + secondWord
//DISPLAY 'Third Word: ' + thirdWord
//DISPLAY 'Fourth Word: ' + fourthWord
//DISPLAY 'Fifth Word: ' + fifthWord

var word = 'wow JavaScript is so cool';
var firstWord = word[0] + word[1] + word[2];
var secondWord = word[4] + word[5] + word[6] + word[7] + word[8] + word[9] + word[10] + word[11] + word[12] + word[13];
var thirdWord = word[15] + word[16];
var fourthWord = word[18] + word[19];
var fifthWord = word[21] + word[22] + word[23] + word[24];

console.log('First Word: ' + firstWord);
console.log('Second Word: ' + secondWord);
console.log('Third Word: ' + thirdWord);
console.log('Fourth Word: ' + fourthWord);
console.log('Fifth Word: ' + fifthWord);

3. Breaking Sentence (Again) using Substring

//SET and STORE 'word' to 'wow JavaScript is so cool'
//SET and STORE 'firstWord' to show 1st letter to 4th letter 
//SET and STORE 'secondWord' to show 5th letter to 15th letter
//SET and STORE 'thirdWord' to show 16th letter to 18th letter
//SET and STORE 'fourthWord' to show 19th letter to 21st letter
//SET and STORE 'fifthWord' to show 22nd letter to 26th letter
//DISPLAY 'First Word: ' + firstWord
//DISPLAY 'Second Word: ' + secondWord
//DISPLAY 'Third Word: ' + thirdWord
//DISPLAY 'Fourth Word: ' + fourthWord
//DISPLAY 'Fifth Word: ' + fifthWord

var word = 'wow JavaScript is so cool';
var firstWord = word.substring(0, 3);
var secondWord = word.substring(4, 14);
var thirdWord = word.substring(15, 17);
var fourthWord = word.substring(18, 20);
var fifthWord = word.substring(21, 25);

console.log('First Word: ' + firstWord);
console.log('Second Word: ' + secondWord);
console.log('Third Word: ' + thirdWord);
console.log('Fourth Word: ' + fourthWord);
console.log('Fifth Word: ' + fifthWord);

4. Breaking Sentence (yet Again) and Count Each Length

//SET and STORE 'word' to 'wow JavaScript is so cool'
//SET and STORE 'firstWord' to show 1st letter to 4th letter 
//SET and STORE 'secondWord' to show 5th letter to 15th letter
//SET and STORE 'thirdWord' to show 16th letter to 18th letter
//SET and STORE 'fourthWord' to show 19th letter to 21st letter
//SET and STORE 'fifthWord' to show 22nd letter to 26th letter
//SET and STORE 'firstWordLength' to show length from 1st letter to 4th letter 
//SET and STORE 'secondWordLength' to show length from 5th letter to 15th letter
//SET and STORE 'thirdWordLength' to show length from 16th letter to 18th letter
//SET and STORE 'fourthWordLength' to show length from 19th letter to 21st letter
//SET and STORE 'fifthWordLength' to show length from 22nd letter to 26th letter
//DISPLAY 'First Word: ' + firstWord + ', with length: ' + firstWordLength
//DISPLAY 'Second Word: ' + secondWord + ', with length: ' + secondWordLength
//DISPLAY 'Third Word: ' + thirdWord + ', with length: ' + thirdWordLength
//DISPLAY 'Fourth Word: ' + fourthWord + ', with length: ' + fourthWordLength
//DISPLAY 'Fifth Word: ' + fifthWord + ', with length: ' + fifthWordLength

var word = 'wow JavaScript is so cool';
var firstWord = word.substring(0, 3);
var secondWord = word.substring(4, 14);
var thirdWord = word.substring(15, 17);
var fourthWord = word.substring(18, 20);
var fifthWord = word.substring(21, 25);

var firstWordLength = firstWord.length;
var secondWordLength = secondWord.length;
var thirdWordLength = thirdWord.length;
var fourthWordLength = fourthWord.length;
var fifthWordLength = fifthWord.length;

console.log('First Word: ' + firstWord + ', with length: ' + firstWordLength);
console.log('Second Word: ' + secondWord + ', with length: ' + secondWordLength);
console.log('Third Word: ' + thirdWord + ', with length: ' + thirdWordLength);
console.log('Fourth Word: ' + fourthWord + ', with length: ' + fourthWordLength);
console.log('Fifth Word: ' + fifthWord + ', with length: ' + fifthWordLength);
